# Hacking Book Chatbot

A context-aware, book-trained chatbot built using cutting-edge NLP techniques. This project utilizes natural language processing to provide intelligent and relevant answers from a curated collection of hacking and cybersecurity books sourced from [tanc7/hacking-books](https://github.com/tanc7/hacking-books).

## Dataset

This chatbot is trained on a selection of hacking and cybersecurity books. The original corpus is sourced from:

- [https://github.com/tanc7/hacking-books](https://github.com/tanc7/hacking-books)

Books were preprocessed, cleaned, chunked, and embedded to enable semantic search and context-aware interactions.

## Features

- Fast, intelligent question answering over book content  
- Semantic similarity via sentence embeddings  
- Chunked context retrieval from large documents  
- Interactive querying of technical content in cybersecurity, ethical hacking, reverse engineering, and more
